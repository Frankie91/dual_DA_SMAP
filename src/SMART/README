SMART version 3 - created on September, 24, 2016 for Yixin.

Recommended execution line:

SMART(6,3,0,999,100,3,5,1,0,0.60,1,1);

See SMART.m for definition of all arguments

New: You can now find the increment ensemble in the global variable "increment_ens" within SMART.m.

However, I have NOT yet changed the code to yield an ensemble of rainfall corrections (i.e. correction.m STILL only corrects rainfall
using a single deterministic (i.e. ensemble-averged) increment.

A few other things to note:

1) "increment_ens" is a matrix of size Number ensembles x Number of days. The determistic increment in "increment" is avaraged within 
the window size (set using the last argument to SMART). For this project, the window size should (probably) be always set to 1...so this 
difference is not important...however, keep that in mind is case you ever want to change the window size.

2) The lambda value used to scale the increments should not vary across the ensemble. Keep that in mind when you modify "correction.m" to output
an ensemble of corrected rainfall.

3) As before, "sum_rain_corrected" contains the corrected rainfall.

4) Changing the first argument from 6 to 5 will change the filtering approach to a standard Kalman filter/Kalman smoother and speed things up 
greatly. The accuracy of the deterministic results will not be impacted; however, no ensemble will be produced.

Email me with any questions.

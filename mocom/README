mocom-ua.aww was the original code from UW as modified & upgraded by A. Wood.  PCIC
later went through the code and report to have fixed several bugs, though this is 
unverified by code review.  The arguments to the code change differ slightly, and PCIC
added a daily stats calculator so that if daily flows are available, they could also be used.  

=================

Two more recent versions of MOCOM sent by PCIC/Katrina Bennett around 2009.  The 
apr-dm one seems most recent.

PCIC apparently found some bug fixes that were important, so this should be used. 

The src_bin/ dir has the apr-dm/ codes

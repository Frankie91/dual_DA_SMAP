MOCOM notes -- A. Wood, 2014
v2:  altered pcic one to re-implement the functionality for passing an archive name to the 
       run script

v3:  trying to fix problem w/ removing the dirs that have good runs
       added documentation

     -- reformatted all output to be more readable
     -- seems like the INVALID params get repeated from time to time -- why?
